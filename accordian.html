            <div class="ans">
               <p>Answer: To start as a web developer, you should focus on learning the following key skills:
                🌐 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for structuring web content.
                🎨 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout.  
                💻 JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic content.
                🔗 Version control using Git and GitHub to manage code and collaborate with others.
                📱 Responsive design principles to ensure your websites look good on all devices.

              <i class="icon active fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="ans active">
              <p>Answer:💻Front-End Development focuses on the visual part of the website that users interact with. If you enjoy working with design, user experience (UX), and interactivity, front-end is a good choice.
                🌐Back-End Development involves server-side logic, databases, and APIs. If you're interested in working with databases, server management, and complex logic, back-end might suit you.
                📚Full-Stack Development covers both front-end and back-end. If you want to work on both the user-facing side and the server-side, becoming a full-stack developer is an option.

            </div> 
           <div class="ans">
             <p>Answer:HTML and CSS are the foundation of web development and are non-negotiable.
              🟡 JavaScript is essential for front-end development.
              🧠 For back-end, consider learning 💚 Node.js (JavaScript 🟡),  🐍 Python,  💎 Ruby, or  🐘 PHP.
               As you advance, 🗄️learning SQL for databases and 🔵 TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript) can be beneficial.</p>

         </div> 
        <div class="ans">
          <p>Answer: Learning frameworks like React ⚛️, Vue.js 🇻, or Angular 🅰️ for front-end, and Express.js 🇪 (for Node.js 🇳) or Django 🐍 (for Python 🐍) for back-end can make your development process more efficient and scalable.
            These tools are widely used in the industry, so understanding them can increase your employability.
            However, before diving into frameworks, ensure you have a strong grasp of vanilla HTML 🌐, CSS 🎨, and JavaScript 🟡.
